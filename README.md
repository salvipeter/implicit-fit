# Implicit Fit

Implementation of the basic ideas in the paper

[Ch.L. Bajaj, I. Ihm, *Algebraic surface design with Hermite interpolation*, ACM TOG 11(1), pp. 61-91, 1992.](https://doi.org/10.1145/102377.120081)

Output is generated by my [dual contouring library](http://github.com/salvipeter/dual-contouring).

## Features
- Boundary loops consisting of rational Bézier curves of arbitrary degrees
- Blended normal vector fences (blend degree can be any odd degree - or 0, meaning no normal constraint)
- Additional points and/or normal vectors can also be interpolated
- Interpolation with an implicit surface of arbitrary degree

## Input
Three file formats:
- GBP (my file format for Generalized Bézier patches, see the [Transfinite library](https://github.com/salvipeter/transfinite))
- CRV, containing rational quadratic curves in the following format:
```
x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 w2
```
where `w2` is the weight of the second control point (assuming `w1=w3=1`).
- SBV, describing a setback vertex blend in the following format:
```
cx cy cz 0
x1 y1 z1 r1
x2 y2 z2 r2
...
```
where `(cx,cy,cz)` is the center point, `(xi,yi,zi)` is the i-th setback vertex,
and `ri` is the range of the i-th profile curve.
