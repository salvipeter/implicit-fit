Additional LSQ energy can be added in the following way:

- assume   A1 x = 0   contains the original constraints
- assume   A2 x = 0   contains the LSQ minimization

=> solve    A x = 0   where   A = M' * A2' * A2 * M   and M = nullspace(A1)

When the LSQ minimization has a RHS vector:   A2 x = b2

=> solve    A y = b   where   b = M' * A2' * b2    and x = M * y
